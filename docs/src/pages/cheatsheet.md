# Markdown Cheat Sheet

Thanks for visiting [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org)!

This Markdown cheat sheet provides a quick overview of all the Markdown syntax elements. It can’t cover every edge case, so if you need more information about any of these elements, refer to the reference guides for [basic syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax) and [extended syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax).

## Basic Syntax

These are the elements outlined in John Gruber’s original design document. All Markdown applications support these elements.

### Heading

# H1

## H2

### H3

### Bold

**bold text**

### Italic

_italicized text_

### Blockquote

> blockquote

### Ordered List

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

### Unordered List

- First item
- Second item
- Third item

### callout

{% callout title="You should know!" type="warning" %}
This is what a disclaimer message looks like. You might want to include inline `code` in it. Or maybe you’ll want to include a [link](/) in it. I don’t think we should get too carried away with other scenarios like lists or tables — that would be silly.
{% /callout %}

### Code

`code`

### Horizontal Rule
