title: JS SDK
---

The `@everfund/js-sdk` library contains the core logic for JS SDK. If you use a non-standard framework or don't have access to a framework, you can use the JS SDK directly via TypeScript or JavaScript.

```js
// npm
npm install @everfund/js-sdk

//yarn
yarn add @everfund/js-sdk
```
