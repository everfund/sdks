Donation Links, also known as Everfund's No Code tool, can be generated from inside the dashboard. Their primary use is a deploying an easy way for nonprofits to accept a donation without the need to direct donors to their websites. Sharing on social media, on QR codes, or across messaging platforms is where Donation Links are most effective.

Donation Links can be branded to which ever appeal or campaign a nonprofit is running and there is no limit to how many you may generate. It give you the chance to A/B test different Donation Link content or use different Donation Links across multiple channels to see where your fundraising is converting at a high level.
